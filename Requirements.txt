Open the App in Your Browser: Open your browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

This should display your To-Do List web app!

Test the Features: You should be able to:

Add tasks.
View the list of tasks.
Mark tasks as completed.
Delete tasks.
Debugging (if needed): If anything goes wrong, the terminal where the Flask server is running will show detailed error messages, which can help in debugging.

Next Steps:
You can start adding more features to the app, like editing tasks or saving tasks to a file or database.
You can also deploy the app to platforms like Heroku or PythonAnywhere once you're happy with it.
