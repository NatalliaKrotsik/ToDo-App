"To-Do List" app. 

It will allow users to:

# Add tasks.
# List all tasks.
# Mark tasks as completed.

Setting up Git and the main repository:

Create a repository on GitHub.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Push this initial version of the app to the repository.
Creating a Branch for New Features: Once you have your repository set up, here’s what you can do:

Create a branch for a new feature (e.g., adding a function to delete tasks).
After the feature is added and tested, you’ll merge it back to the main branch.
Here’s how you would do that:

# Step 1: Initialize git and commit the initial version
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with basic to-do app"

# Step 2: Push the initial commit to the remote repository
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin main

# Step 3: Create a new branch for a feature (e.g., delete task feature)
git checkout -b delete-feature

# Add the "delete task" function to the app here, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add delete task functionality"

# Step 4: Push the branch with the new feature to GitHub
git push -u origin delete-feature

# Step 5: Create a pull request on GitHub to merge the feature into the main branch
# After merging, pull the latest changes to your local repository
git checkout main
git pull origin main
